## About

Roach Run is a first-person shooter game where the enemies are... cockroaches! Your goal is to kill as many as possible before getting touched by too many of them and becoming overwhelmed with fear.

Your weapon of choice is a cockroach-killer spray. Unfortunately, its content is limited so you have to keep an eye for power-ups randomly spawning around the house every now and then. Every time you kill a cockroach you gain score points and an ammo bonus and your fear diminishes by a certain amount.

As if all that isn't horrific enough, cockroaches will appear at an increasing rate as you kill more and more of them.

You can control your character in the typical first-person shooter fashion, that is, using the WASD or arrow keys to move, spacebar to jump, shift keys to run, the mouse to look around and the left mouse button to fire.

Roach Run was developed as a demonstration and educational aid for the purposes of the Digital Games Development seminar organized by the Interactive Systems Design Laboratory, Department of Product and System Design Engineering, University of the Aegean and held in September 2018 in Syros, Greece. As such, it is purposely incomplete (things like proper bounding shapes, navigation meshes on furniture, enemy health bars, game mechanics fine-tuning, etc., left to students as exercises).
